Hi, my name is marcus and I am a PhD student at DIKU in the image section under Mads Nielsen and Stefan Sommer. I am a part of the <a hfref="https://www.ccem.dk/">Center for Computational Evolutionary Morphometry</a>, and my daily work is mostly in deep learning, shape stochastics and computational morphology.

I have a passion for both writing clean and effective deep learning code, but also a deep interest in score based modeling. Expect to see both on this blog.
